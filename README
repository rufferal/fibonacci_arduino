In this setup I have a NOR transistor logic gate hooked up to the Arduino.
As NOR is a universal gate, every other logical operation can be performed
through recursive calls to NOR.

Here I have an adder for 32-bit unsigned integers, which is used to calculate
the first 48 terms of the Fibonacci Sequence.
